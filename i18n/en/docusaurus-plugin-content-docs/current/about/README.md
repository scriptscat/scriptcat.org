## About ScriptCat

ScriptCat is inspired by Tampermonkey's design philosophy and supports Tampermonkey scripts. It implements a background script execution framework, provides special APIs that allow scripts to do more, and offers an excellent editor to make script development more comfortable and smooth.

For our development plans, please see: [Project #1](https://github.com/scriptscat/scriptcat/projects/1), where we publish our development roadmap. If you have any good suggestions, you can also submit an [issue](https://github.com/scriptscat/scriptcat/issues) to give us feedback.

**If you find it useful, please give us a Star ❤❤❤**

## Tampermonkey Chinese Community

Tampermonkey Chinese Community is a community we created for the development and exchange of Tampermonkey scripts. In the forum, we have very rich script learning materials and many experts. You can communicate in the forum and ask questions to the experts. We also provide script publishing and installation, allowing everyone to freely share their scripts.
