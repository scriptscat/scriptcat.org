# Introduction

This extension supports three types of scripts:

- Frontend scripts
- [Background scripts](./background.md)
- [Scheduled scripts](./background.md#scheduled-scripts)

Frontend scripts are traditional userscripts (like Tampermonkey scripts). Background scripts and scheduled scripts are unique features supported by the ScriptCat extension. Please refer to the corresponding documentation for details.

You can learn about [Tampermonkey APIs](./api.md) and [ScriptCat's background scripts](./background.md) through this documentation. Additionally, we maintain a [Userscript Development Guide](https://learn.scriptcat.org/) documentation site with rich learning resources. Everyone is welcome to join the discussion.

For areas where the documentation is incomplete, you can provide feedback on [Github](https://github.com/scriptscat/scriptcat.org) or submit a PR to help us improve.
