# Synchronization and Backup

Supports the following cloud storage:

- [x] WebDAV
- [x] Baidu NetDisk
- [x] OneDrive
- [x] Google Drive
- [x] Dropbox

## Synchronization

When a script is updated, it will be immediately synchronized to the cloud. However, when cloud data changes, it takes some time to scan and synchronize to local. Please note this when multiple devices share the same cloud storage.

Clicking Save in the script synchronization section will immediately perform a full synchronization.
